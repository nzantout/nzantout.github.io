I am a second year Master's of Science in Robotics student at the [Robotics Institute](https://www.ri.cmu.edu), within the [School of Computer Science](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/) at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/). I conduct research as part of the [Field Robotics Center](https://frc.ri.cmu.edu/) in collaboration with the [AirLab](https://theairlab.org/), co-advised by [Ji Zhang](https://frc.ri.cmu.edu/~zhangji/) and [Wenshan Wang](http://www.wangwenshan.com/). My research interests include 3D semantic scene understanding, vision-language navigation, and language-conditioned action policies.

I graduated with high distinction from the [American University of Beirut](https://www.aub.edu.lb/) with a B.Eng. in Electrical and Computer Engineering, where I worked with [Naseem Daher](https://www.aub.edu.lb/pages/profile.aspx?memberId=nd38) on [pothole detection and avoidance for autonomous cars](https://github.com/AUBVRL/pothole-detection-avoidance-agv), and with [Imad Elhajj](https://www.aub.edu.lb/pages/profile.aspx?memberId=ie05) on assistive teleoperation.
